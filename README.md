# Watson Studio Local Workshop (for version 1.2.2)
In this workshop you will learn how to develop and deploy applications in Watson Studio Local (WSL). The workshop has been divided into several stand-alone parts for those who are interested in a certain development tool or deployment task. 

## About this repository
This repository contains several lab subfolders. Some labs include notebooks and data, while others have additional instructions that are located in the *Lab Instructions* folder. 

## Prerequisites 
1. To run this workshop you need an instance of WSL. **Please note that while most code is the same between Watson Studio Local and Cloud, the notebooks included in sample projects will work in Watson Studio Local only**
2. Download and unzip this [this repository](https://codeload.github.com/elenalowery/WSL_Workshop/zip/master). Unzip the repository only, not files in subfolders. 

### Setting up lab projects in WSL
1. Rename **WSL_Demos.zip** located in *Projects** folder of the unzipped repository to a unique name, for example, add your initials.    *Note: Project names in WSL cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name*. 
2. Log in to WSL.
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File".
4. Browse to the .zip file and click **Create**.
